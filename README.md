# Destroyer

Destroyer is a script created by Fantin Bibas.
Destroyer's goal is to destroy the computer of the victim by creating aliases in the bashrc, playing with the screen, changing the keyboard, etc...

The script is not working and is in contruction for the moment.

With great power comes great responsibility

Enjoy.
